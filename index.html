            <p>Jeff Raimundo is a self proclaimed Aviation Geek with Googling aspirations.  Born in on the mean streets of Butte MT, to a family of would be pilots and life-long airline employees, he did the natural thing and sought a degree in history on a football scholarship.  After graduation, he was shocked to realized that the streets were not paved with gold for a beer swilling historian.</p>
            <p>Shortly after he packed up the pick-up, grabbed is dog and hit the road headed for Arizona.  There he attended Arizona State University in the Aeronautical Flight Management program and started his career as professional pilot and Airline employee.</p>
